PhyloSynth is a collaborative group of scientists that aim to provide an updated framework and set of phylogenies for the plant Tree of Life.<p>

We got together because we want to find new ways to provide an integrated, up-to-date, high quality, open, reproducible and sustainable plant Tree of Life to a diverse user community. You can find out more about our vision <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajb2.1041">here</a>.<p>
