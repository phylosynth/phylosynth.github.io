We are pleased to announce a half-day Phylogenomics Software Symposium, which will be held at the Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution - Montpellier, on the University of Montpellier campus. This symposium will take place on August 17, the day before the Evolution 2018 meeting begins.

The conference will include two sessions of invited talks and one session of contributed talks. The invited talks will describe recent breakthroughs in methods and software that address challenges in phylogenetics using large and heterogeneous sequence datasets. Contributed talks will be selected from submitted abstracts; these may also describe advances in software, novel challenges, or discoveries made using new methods.

Travel awards are available, and registration in advance is required.
