We are pleased to have <a href="https://github.com/DomBennett"> Dr. Dom Bennet</a> visitng us! He is a post-doc in the <a href="http://antonelli-lab.net/"> Antonelli Lab </a> at the University of Gothenburg (Sweden), working on pipelines in R for phylogenetic analysis. He has quite impressive productivities in <a href="https://www.dominicjbennett.com/#software"> R packages </a>.  

We had a great time together, and quite enjoyed his visit. Dom Bennet gave us a <a href="https://github.com/AntonelliLab/supersmartR-workshop"> **supersmartR-workshop** </a> on his first day of visit. He demonstrated how to integrate his published R packages as modules forming an efficient pipeline via <a href="https://github.com/AntonelliLab/outsider"> **outsider** </a> and <a href="https://www.docker.com/"> **Docker** </a>, from data mining in GenBank to supertree grafting. **_That was quite computational intense one-day worshop!_** All the details and tutorials are available <a href="https://github.com/AntonelliLab/supersmartR-workshop"> here </a>.  

On the second day, we had compared the features of two pipelines <a href="https://github.com/AntonelliLab/supersmartR"> **supersmartR** </a> and <a href="https://github.com/FePhyFoFum/PyPHLAWD"> **PyPHLAWD** </a>. We were trying to tear those great features from both pipelines apart, to investigate which of those features could be best suit for Phylosynth project. Our meeting notes can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJHEyHHmsQxjFUxUw1kbeLIPoh--IXDjD49QWa0Sdlg/edit"> Google Doc here </a>.
